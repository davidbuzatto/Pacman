- Decrease speed of ghosts when in scatter mode;

- Implement different behaviors for each ghost:

    - Blinky (red): Follows Pac-Man directly during Chase mode, and heads to 
      the upper-right corner during Scatter mode. He also has an "angry" mode
      that is triggered when there are a certain number of dots left in the
      maze;

    - Inky (cyan): During Chase mode, his target is a bit complex. His target
      is relative to both Blinky and Pac-Man, where the distance Blinky is from
      Pinky's target is doubled to get Inky's target. He heads to the lower-right
      corner during Scatter mode;

    - Pinky (pink): Chases towards the spot 2 Pac-Dots in front of Pac-Man. Due
      to a bug in the original game's coding, if Pac-Man faces upwards, Pinky's
      target will be 2 Pac-Dots in front of and 2 to the left of Pac-Man. During
      Scatter mode, she heads towards the upper-left corner.

    - Clyde (orange): Chases directly after Pac-Man, but tries to head to his
      Scatter corner when within an 8-Dot radius of Pac-Man. His Scatter Mode
      corner is the lower-left.
